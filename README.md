# Adiabatic Quantum Annealing Notebooks

I used these notebooks to develop my fourth year masters dissertation project on adiabatic quantum annealing devices, ie quantum computers.

The research question I was addressing was 'how does the schedule of the annealing process affect the reliability of the result?'. This basically means how in practice to we vary the electromagnetic fields in a quantum compouter, like D-Wave, so that the answer that comes out is more likely to be right. If you are more mathematically minded it boils down to computationally solving different path integrals whilst changing the path and trying to figure out the 'best one'.

The code in these notebooks relies on the code in my other github repo, of a very similar name, which includes the `Anneal` object
